## Phase_1

* user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

* As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products
* As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category
* As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence
